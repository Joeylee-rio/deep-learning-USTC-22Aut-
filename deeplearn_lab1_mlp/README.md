### Lab1 Use a Simple Neural Network to Realize Sine-Func Regression Task
#### To explore the influence on the model brought by different hyperparameters: `learning rate`, `activation function type`, `width of hidden layer`, `depth of hidden layer`.
##### For more description on lab1, please see `deep_learning_assignment_1.pdf`
##### For more experiment results, please find in the `results`
##### To replicate/Run the experiments, just use the command `bash run_one_click.sh`
